This directory should contain the following audio files:

1. ambient.mp3: Background ambient music for the museum
2. whoosh.mp3: Sound effect for movement

You can download or create these files and place them here. 
The application will try to load them but will continue to work even if they're missing.

For ambient sounds, consider using slow, atmospheric music.
For the whoosh effect, a soft air movement sound works well.
